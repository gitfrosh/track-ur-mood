# track-ur-mood
Track your daily mood with this nifty Electron.js app which runs on Next.js under the hood. Data is stored in a lowdb powered Hapi.js (Node.js) backend. This is just fun stuff!!

### Start the Node.js backend on port 3000
* cd backen
* yarn install
* yarn start

### Start the Electron.js app in dev mode (no prod settings implemented, sorry!)
* cd frontend-electron
* yarn install
* yarn develop
